# `share` — a remote Store for publishing and listing transcripts

Status: **design sketch**, for the *client* half. The service half is built:
`share-core` decides, `share-store` defines the storage seams, and
`worker/` is a thin shell over both. What remains unbuilt is the
`Store` implementation below, which lets `txcript list`/`view`/`continue`
reach a share service.

Two things it needs from the library first, neither of which exists yet:
`http::Agent` has no plain-client constructor (it always applies the
Chrome148 browser profile, which a service we own neither needs nor wants)
and is GET-only, while publishing needs PUT and DELETE.

## Shape

`share` is a *pseudo-harness* in the mould of `campfire.rs`: it reuses another
module's `Body`, `Codec`, and `TextCodec` verbatim and changes only its
identity and its storage. Campfire delegates to `pi` and swaps the sessions
root; `share` delegates to `simple` and swaps a directory for a URL.

That choice follows from what `simple.rs` already says about itself — it is
the one format with deliberately no `Store`, because a Simple session is "a
document handed to txcript directly … not something discovered from or
written into a managed location". `share` is exactly that document at rest
behind a URL, so the conversion core needs no changes at all.

Listing other people's sessions is the point of the feature, so `discover()`
is the primary operation, not an afterthought: the Worker's `GET /s` returns
metadata only (R2 custom metadata, one round trip per 1000 sessions) and
never document bodies.

## Access control

Not implemented here, by design. The service sits behind Cloudflare Access;
the client's entire auth surface is a header map. **Without that external
gate the service is public even over HTTPS** — see the SECURITY note at the
foot of `worker/src/index.js`.

## `src/harness/share.rs`

```rust
//! share — publish transcripts to an HTTP service, and list what others
//! have published.
//!
//! A thin delegate over [`simple`]: the body, codec, and text codec are
//! Simple's, reused verbatim; only the identity and the store differ.
//!
//! Authorization is deliberately absent from this module. The service is
//! expected to sit behind an authenticating proxy (Cloudflare Access, and
//! anything else that speaks in headers); this store only attaches the
//! credentials an [`Auth`] provider hands it. An unauthenticated endpoint
//! is a public endpoint, HTTPS or not.

### Three guards that are not optional

1. **Slug validation before it becomes a URL path.** Slugs arrive from the
   service, so the store treats them as untrusted exactly as
   `harness::checked_id_component` treats session ids: two plain segments,
   no `/`-escapes, no `.`/`..`, no control characters. `tests/integration/
   path_safety.rs` is the home for the adversarial cases.
2. **Redirects are errors, not content.** Already handled: `http::Agent`
   builds its client with `redirect(Policy::none())` (`src/http.rs:95`), so
   `share` inherits it and must not re-add it locally. It matters here more
   than for the harnesses it was written for — an unauthenticated request to
   an Access-protected origin gets a **302 to the SSO login page, not a
   401**. Following it would parse an HTML login form as a transcript.
3. **Credentials never reach an error string.** `claude_chat.rs:2499` tests
   this with a token literally named `secret-never-print`, asserting it is
   absent from the rendered error. Mirror it for the Access headers.

## Wiring

The `harness` skill's Phase 5 list, corrected — item 4 names `src/bin/cli.rs`,
which no longer exists; the CLI is a workspace member now.

1. `src/harness/share.rs` — the module above.
2. `src/harness/mod.rs` — `pub mod share;`
3. `src/transcript.rs` — `HarnessId::Share`, `ALL` (17 → 18), `as_str`,
   `FromStr` aliases (`share`, `gist`).
4. `src/local.rs` — `Locator::ShareRemote(ShareRef)` plus arms in
   `discover_harness`, `Session::read`, `Session::delete`, `location()`.
5. `cli/src/lib.rs` — `load_direct_share`, mirroring `load_direct_chatgpt`
   (`:517`) so `txcript view <slug>` is one fetch with no enumeration.
6. `src/wasm.rs` — both dispatch matches, delegating to Simple's codec.
7. `Cargo.toml` — a `share` feature (`dep:wreq`, `dep:tokio`); codec stays
   featureless so the WASM build is unaffected.
8. `README.md`, `docs/usage.md`.
9. Tests, below.

### Two decisions this forces

- **Does `share` appear in a bare `txcript list`?** **Decided: yes, but only
  when `TXCRIPT_SHARE_URL` is set.** `src/local.rs:101` says "Live web
  harnesses are deliberately excluded from aggregate discovery" — claude_chat
  and chatgpt appear only under an explicit `--from`, because discovery would
  otherwise put a network round trip on every `list` and `query`. Listing
  others' sessions is the whole point of `share`, so it is included in
  aggregate discovery — but configuring the endpoint is what opts you in.
  Unset means not configured, which discovers nothing and contacts nobody.
  This keeps the no-config default exactly as fast as it is today.
- **Extract `src/http.rs` first.** Done and merged — `http::Agent` backs both
  `claude_chat` and `chatgpt`, so `share` reuses it instead of adding a third
  copy of the transport. Two things about it shape the `share` work:
  - `Agent::start` hardcodes the Chrome148 emulation profile. `share` talks to
    a service we own and wants none of that fingerprinting — it needs either a
    profile argument or a plain-client constructor. **This is the one library
    change `share` requires, and it should land before the store.**
  - `Request` already splits `headers` from `sensitive`, which is exactly the
    shape an `Auth` provider wants: credentials go in `sensitive`, everything
    else in `headers`. Both name headers with `&'static str` though, so a
    header name read from an env var at runtime cannot be passed without
    leaking it. Widen both to `Cow<'static, str>`; the existing call sites
    pass literals and coerce unchanged.
  - `Agent::get` is GET-only. Publishing needs PUT and DELETE, so the agent
    grows a method (or a verb field) as part of the same change.

## Tests

`tests/README.md` requires integration tests to use real backing stores and
no mocks. For an HTTP store the honest analogue is a real server on a
loopback port, which both remote stores already do:
`TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:0")` at `chatgpt.rs:939` and
`claude_chat.rs:2113`, driven through a `for_test(base_url)` constructor.

| Test | Proves |
|---|---|
| `store_round_trip_is_lossless` | `save` → `load` preserves the document, unknown top-level keys included |
| `discover_extracts_metadata` | every populated `Meta` field survives the R2 custom-metadata projection |
| `discover_pages_through_a_truncated_listing` | the cursor loop terminates and concatenates in order |
| `save_without_credentials_is_refused_locally` | `Anonymous` fails fast, no request sent |
| `a_login_redirect_is_an_auth_error_not_a_parse_error` | the Access 302 case |
| `slug_traversal_is_rejected` | `../` and absolute slugs cannot escape the path (`path_safety.rs`) |
| `fingerprints_come_from_etags_without_a_request` | the search cache skips unchanged sessions |
| `credentials_never_appear_in_an_error` | mirrors `claude_chat.rs:2499` |

The codec fixpoint and `cross_harness` hop are inherited from Simple and add
nothing here — `properties.rs` already sweeps that codec. The value in this
integration is entirely at the Store boundary.
