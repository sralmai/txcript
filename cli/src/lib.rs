//!
//! By default `continue` launches the harness from the recorded working
//! directory when it still exists. Resume commands are overridable per harness
//! via `TRANSCRIPT_<HARNESS>_RESUME_CMD` (a `{id}` template).
//!
//! `#range` is a 1-based, inclusive message range (`#7`, `#5-12`, `#5-`,
//! `#-10`); `view` prints the matching ordinals, so what you see is what you
//! reference. See `fragment.rs`.
//!
//! Anywhere a session id is accepted, any unambiguous prefix of it works too;
//! an ambiguous prefix errors with the candidates. Exact ids and titles win
//! over prefix interpretation.
//!
//! Session discovery/conversion lives in [`txcript::local`]; ranking lives in
//! [`txcript::search`].
